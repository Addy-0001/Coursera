Virtulaization
        - Catalyst for evolutions in computing.

Hypervisors
        - Small software layer that allows multiple operating

        - Assigns each a slice of memory, computing power and 
          prevents intereference between each other. 
Cloud computing helps switch from CapEx model to OpEx model.

OpEx: Low to no up front costs

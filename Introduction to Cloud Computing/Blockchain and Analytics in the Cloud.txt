It's a 3 way relationship. 
Blockchain records the data and variables that go 
Blockchain is a secure, distributed, open technology that can help speed up processes, 
lower costs, and build transparency and traceability in transactional applications. It
is an immutable Network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant
to them. The more open, diverse, and distributed the network, the stronger the trust and transparency 
in the data and transactions. 85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT needs,
with more than 70% using more than three. These businesses need to be able to move applications and 
data across multiple clouds easily and securely, leading to the emerging demand to build and manage 
business applications such as blockchain for the multi cloud environment. Blockchain and AI, much
like IoT and AI, powered by the cloud, also have a three-way relationship. Where blockchain 
technology provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and
decision-making from the data collected, and cloud provides globally distributed, scalable, 
and cost-efficient computing resources to support both the unprecedented amounts of data being
collected and the processing power required to draw insights from this data. Blockchain serves 
to make AI more understandable by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made
in an AI algorithm, leading to greater trust and transparency in the conclusions and decisions made
by these algorithms. Let's look at how blockchain on the cloud is helping farmers reduce waste at times
of recall by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain.

How can analytics technology leverage the cloud?
- Track trends on social media to predict future events 
- Analyze data to build machine learning models in cognitive applications
- Data analytics and predictive maintenance solutions for city infrastructure.

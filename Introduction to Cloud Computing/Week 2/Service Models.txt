Overview of Cloud Service Models
- 3 Service Models
    - SaaS 
        . It is just software that doesn't need to be installed
          on our machine and doesn't have to be updated 
          manually. 
          Anyone can be a user of Software as a Service. 
    - PaaS 
        . Takes advantage from all the virtualization from IaaS
          and subtracts them away so that the user doesn't have
          to worry about managing those virtualized resources. 
    - IaaS
        . Set of computer networking and storage resources that
          have been virtualized by a vendor so that a user can
          access and configure them anyway they want.

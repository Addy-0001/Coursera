Lesson Summary for Introduction to cloud computing
In this lesson, you have learned:
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources 
over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are 
dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale
up and down in response to users’ needs. 

The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes
of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors 
serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud 
computing.

Organizations must consider their business needs, investment 
viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption 
strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business 
disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this 
technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of 
services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software 
services. Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, 
Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

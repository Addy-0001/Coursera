    - git send email
        to send your email submission without corruption
        by your MUA
    - git request pull
        to create a summary of changes for your upstream to
        pull. 

Git Integrator:
 . An Integrator
    - Recieves changes made by others
    - Reviews and responds to pull requests
    - Publishes the result for others to use
 . Integrators use the following commands
    - git am
      to apply patches emailed in from the contributors
    - git pull 
      to merge from your trusted lieutenants
    - git format patch
      to prepare and send suggested alternative to
      to contributors
    - git revert
      to undo botched commits
    - git push
      to publish the bleeding edge. 

GitHub Repository Administrator
A repository admin sets up and maintains access to the repo
by developers.
 . git daemon
   to allow anonymous download from repo
 . git shell
   used as a restricted login shell for shared central repo
   users
 . git http backend
   provides a server side implementation of git over http 
   allowing both fetch and push services. 
 . gitweb 
   provides a web front end to git repositories, which can
   be set up using the git instaweb script. 
Github Admins can use GitHub Actions to automate software 
workflows including CI/CD.

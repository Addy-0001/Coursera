CSS - Styling an HTML file

Objectives:
 - Explain what a Cascade Style Sheet is
 - How to use CSS to format HTML elements
 - How to use CSS in HTML docs to format webpages

Media Independence with HTML and CSS 
 - Give developers flexibility to targer web and mobile devices
    - Android, iOS and tablets support HTML5
    - Apple IOS doesn't support the same plug in technologies, like flash.

 - NO requirement to download potenitally pre-compiled binary files

 - They represent a media-independent description of interactive content
    - to influence how a document is rendered on a screen, authors can use a styling language such as CSS 
    - HTML tags can be read by screen readers to meet accessibility requirements

What is CSS?
 - Css is the design that is layered over the top of an HTML web page

 - CSS describes how HTML elements are displayed.

 - Developers apply CSS to create a uniform look throughout each element of each page of the website. 

 - Child and descendant elements often inherit styles that are defined for parent elements. However, exceptions to the rules do exist.

CSS design and Coding
 - For websites, it is an important concept to separate the data from the design
    - The data is sent to the browser by using HTML, and the design is applied to that data by using a CSS
    - This sepatation allows the people to render a web page without your design if they have special accessibility needs
    - It allows machines (such as search engines) to index a website without the design interfering

 - You can code CSS as a style attribute in an HTML tag, a head section of a document or an external document. 
    - The preference is to code CSS in external documents (referred to as style sheets)\

What elements can CSS control
 - you can use CSS to control a document's appearance and specify style rules for the following web page elements:
    - Fonts 
    - Text 
    - Colors
    - Backgrounds 
    - Sizes
    - Borders 
    - spacing 
    - Positioning
    - Visual Effects 
    - tables and 
    - lists

CSS Format 
 html-tag-name
 {
    css-property-key-1 : css-value-1; 
    css-property-key-2 : css-value-2;
 }

 The html-tag-name can be any one of the following elements:
    - any of the tags that you find in HTML code
        - <a>, <div>, <li>, or <label>, etc
    - An ID reference that is displayed with a preceding hash symbol (#) in CSS code 
        - #id-of-html-tag
    - A class reference that is displayed with a preceding dot/period (.) symbol in CSS code
        - .class-of-html-code

Base Styles
 When making a site design, begin by establishing the base style. Establish a base style by styling the body as shown below:
    
    body
    {
        background-color : #EEEEEE; //Makes the body color off white 
        color: #000000; //Makes the text color black
        margin : 0; //Ensures that all content edges match the edge of the browser window frame (margin and padding)
        padding : 0; 
        text-align: left; //Horizontally aligns the textual content to the left using text-align
        font-size: 100%; //Sets the font size to the browser's default using font-size
        font-family: sans-serif; //Uses a sans-serif (a font without the little flicks around the edges) as font family using using font-family.
    }

Guidelines for Base Styles 
 - When a color is specifies, use Red-Green-Blue (RGB) hexadecimal light values
 - When a size is specified, use pixels (indicated by a px after the number) and em, which is indicated by em after the number 
   (that is the size multiplied by the number) or a percentage which is indicated by a % sign after the number
 - Texts can be aligned left, right or center
 - Floats can also be left or right
 -Vertical alignments must be top, middle or Bottom
 - Fonts can be any specific font or font family (serif, sans-serif, or monospace) or even a downloadable font

Choosing a Layout
 - One of the most important decisions that need to be taken while making a website is the choixe of a fluid or a fixed layout. 
    - A fluid layout: 
        - Elements are flexible and can expand or contract based on the browser, the OS and other user preferences
        - These elements can be mostly specified by using percentages and ems
    - A fixed layout: 
        - We specify the height and width of the elements and it stays fixed regardless of which OS or browser we use
        - These elements can be specified using pixels mostly
 - While determining a layout, consider the pros and cons for the fluid and fixed layouts
    - The type of website we chose depends on the type and amount of content and the target website. 

Applying CSS to HTML
 - To apply a CSS to an HTML file, we must tell the browser where to look for the CSS. This is the only true point where HTML references a CSS.
 - We can make the reference in one of two ways, the <style> tag or the <link> tag.
 - Using the Style Tag:
    <style> 
    //The CSS code goes here
    </style>
 - Using the Link Tag:
    <link href = "/styles/style.css" rel = "stylesheet">

            - Disadvantages of the Style tag 
                - Can only be applied to one page
                - Dirties the page with non HTML code 
                - Copying and pasting this page increases the load time of each website

            - Advantages of Link tag
                - Ensures a clean HTML and a smaller page size
                - To use this, the link tag must be added to the head tag section


Summary:
In this module, we learned the following:
 - HTML provides the basic structure of and content for a website using tags. 
 - The HTML dom tree describes how a website is structured. 
 - HTML uses APIs to enhance the user experience when browsing websites.
 - Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites. 
 - HTML5 Browser support tables describe which browsers support which HTML5 Features. 
 - CSS provides a consistent style and design throughout the website.

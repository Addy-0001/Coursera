Client Side JavaScript: With DOM

Objectives
 - Describe the document object model (DOM) hierarchy
 - Describe the window and doeument objects
 - Identify the DOM objects that are commonly used in JS applictions for working with HTML documents. 

The DOM Programming Interface
 - It is the programming interface between HTML or XHTML and
   JavaScript. 
 - It is a browser-based interface for applications and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of the documents. 
 - JS uses the DOM to access and modify webpage elements in the web browser.
 - 4 levels of DOM specifications by W3C
    . Level 0 
        - Refers to DOM objects that were in existence before the
          DOM specifications were released.
    . Level 1
        - Describes the low level interface for structured docs and a 
          specific version for the web -1998
    . Level 2
        - Includes a style sheet model and interfaces for manipulating
          the style information attached to a document
        - In addition, an event model is included. -2000
    . Level 3
        - Specifies content models and document validation
        - Includes namespaces in XML, XML information set and XML schema. -2004
    . Level 4
        - Adds mutation observers as a replacement for mutation events. -2015.

Implementation Standards
 - Each browser has various levels of compatibility with the DOM standard.
    . Not all DOM api calls are supported in every web browser implementation
    . Some web browser implementations exhibit different behavior for the same DOM API call.
    . The JS enginer in most web browsers fully supports level 1, the focus of this unit. 

Basic DOM model for Browsers

                     Window
                       |
    ------------------------------------------
    |             |    |        |             |
  History   Location   |    Navigator     Screen
                       |
                       |
                    Document


 - The window object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy and controls the environment that contains the document
    -Window Object
      . Top of the object hierarchy.
      . When the browser loads a page, the window object is automatically created for you. 
      . You can then access the window object properties and functions from your JS code. 
      . Everything in the DOM takes place in a window.
      . In client side JS, window object serves as the global object.
      . A browser opens a window object on startup, even if the window is blank. 
      . Can explicitly generate a new window with the window.open() method 
      . Can omit the window prefix from object references, for ezample. document.write("text") instead of window.document.write("Text")
      
    - Window Object Dialog Boxes
      . Plain alert Box: alert("message")
      . Conformation OK/Cancel dialog: confirm("Message")
      . Text-Entry Prompt: prompt("Message", "defaultreply")

 - The history object keeps internal details about the recent history of the pages in the browser. It has methods for letting you simulate clicking back or forward
   buttons in a browser.
 - The location object contains information about the url of a page. 
 - The nvigator is an object representation of the client internet browser or user agent. There is no standard that applies to the navigator object, 
   so the property values returned when running queries on the navigator object are not consistent across browsers.  
 - The screen object is used to derive information about a user's screen, such as the dimensions of the screen. It is useful for determining the screen size
   of browser that run on mobile devices. 
 - The document object provides access to all HTML elements within a page. Each HTML object that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. 


HTML Document Object Diagram
 - The following shows the object model for a simple HTML document.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta ...>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
    </html>
 - The object hierarchy matches the HTML containment hierarchy on the left. The object diagram can also be represented as a tree structure that corresponds to the
   structure of the HTML document as:

                  Document
                     |
              ------------------
             |                  |
          DOCTYPE              HTML
                                |
                          -------------
                         |            |
                       HEAD          BODY
                         |
                  --------------
                 |              |
                META          TITLE

 - The branches in the tree structure are termed as nodes. There are two types of nodes in the W3C DOM, element nodes and text nodes.
 - All HTML tags are element nodes. The nodes that contain actual text that go between elements' start tag and end tag are known as text nodes.
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
            <head> </head>
            <body>
              <form>
                <p>
                  <input
                    type="button"
                    onclick="checkpoint1()"
                    value="run checkpoint question1">
                </p>
              </form>
            </body>
          </html>
 - The line feeds between elements are text nodes and are a part of the DOM level 2 tree. 
 - The Dom level 2 tree contains a line feed text node before the paragraph and input elements. 
 - The input element contains all the text that follows the input
 - DOM TREE looks like the following: 
              Form
               |
            ---------
           |         |
        Textnode     p
          "\n"       |
              ---------------
             |        |      |
          Textnode  Input Textnode
            "\n"            "\n"

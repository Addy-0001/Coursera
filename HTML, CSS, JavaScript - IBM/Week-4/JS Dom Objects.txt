Javascript DOM Objects

Objectives
 - Identify the DOM objects xommonly used in Javascript Applications for working with HTML doeuments

DOM HTML-Related Node Types
 - The W3C DOM level 2 defines 12 dfferent types of nodes, seven of which have direct applicability in HTML documents
 - Node types that aren't applicable to HTML are omitted from the table.
 - This table in important in the aspect that, when you view a DOM tree, you understand the meaning of numeric node types 
 - Each node type is a named constant that is also represented by an integer value.
 [see DOM HTML-Related Node Types.png for table]

DOM level 2 Properties
 - The table lists some of the DOM level 2 note object properties and corresponding data types.
 - You see these properties when you view a DOM tree for an HTML page in a browser's developer tools like chrome's devtools
 [See DOM level 2 properties.png for table]

Accessing Document Elements
 - How to access the elements on an HTML page with the DOM API?
 - When the document is loaded, the browser creates arrays for forms, images, anchors, links, applets, and embeds. 
 - Nested Objects are accessed using a dot notation. 
 - To access the first image in a document, use: document.images[0]
 - The arrays are indexed as they occur in the source document. The first index of each array starts at zero. 
 - Each of the array types, such as forms[]. contains an array of elements[] with each index element being the fields or buttons that occur in that form. 
 - You can either reference the elements by it's relative position as document.forms[0].elements[0] or you can do so by with named elements as 
   document.forms["form1"].elements["field1"], or even the shortened document.form1.field1.
 - Since only one document can be present in a window, you can leave out the window prefix. HOwever, you can't omit the doucment prefix from the referenced object.

Object Naming
 - To create script references to objects, you can assign a name to everday object in the HTML document. 
 - Assign a scriptable reference name to an object with the id attribute.
 - In order to assign a scriptable reference name to an HTML element with the ID attribute, use the following conventions: 
    . The id must be a unique name in the document.
    . The name must be in quotation marks. 
    . The name must not start with a numeric digit.
    . The function that is used t oreturn a node object that matches the id value is document.getElementById with the name of the id as a parameter argument. 
        Example: 
            <div id = "grid_container2:> 

            var aDiv = document.getElementById("grid_container2")

            if (aDiv)
            {
                //do something with the element;
                ... 
            }
    . It is suggested that the same value be used for bothr the id and the name attribute when both are used.

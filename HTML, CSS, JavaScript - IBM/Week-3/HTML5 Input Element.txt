HTML5 Input Element
Attributes for the input tag

Objective
 - Describe the Attributes of the HTML5 Input element input type attributes tel, email, datetime, 
   number, range, color

Input for color choser
 - The tag <input type = "color"/> allows the user to select color. The dialog that pops up varies
   depending on the browser
 - Some browsers don't support this input type. In such browsers, This input type is displayed as a
   regular text input field into which the user might type a valid color name or color code.

Input for date
 - The tag <input type = "date"> is a date control attribute (year, month, day) without time zone
 - The dialog that pops up varies depedning on the browse. 

Input for Date and Time
 - <input type = "datetime-local"/> provides input for a time. Year, month, day, hour, minute, AM/PM.
   with no time zone.
 - The time can be typed or entered using the spinner control.

Input for Email
 - <input type = "email"/> is displayed as a regular text field. 
 - It only provides feedback when the input does not follow the email format.

Input for Type Number
 - <input type : "number"/> takes the numeric values as input 
 - Optionally, specify the minimum and maximum values, step size etc. 

Input of type Range
 - <inpute type = "range">
 - Can be used for a range of values.
 - Only the slider itself is shown. Additional JS code is needed to display the value of the slider.

Input of type Search 
 - The differences between search and text are mostly is style
 - <input type = "search"/> 
 - Similar to the text field. 
 - webkit based browsers return the most recent searches. 
 - The search input feild on the safari browser has rounded corners

Input of Phone Numbers
 - <input type = "tel"> 
 - Used for telephone numbers
    - Syntax is <input type = "tel" pattern = "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}">
 - The code <input type = "tel"> doesn't inforce any numeric only input because other many numbers
   have other signs such as plus sign and hypens.
 - We need to supply owr own pattern matcher if we want the browser to validate the telephone number.

Input for URLs
 - <input type = "URL">
 - Used for validating if the user input proper URL or not

Input Attribute "List"
 - <input list = "some list"> uses the <datalist> feature
 - Used with <datalist> tag that includes the option list
 - Not to be confused with the select element, the <datalist> options are only suggestions useful for autocomplete functionality.
 - This option can be used by nesting the option element inside the datalist tag. 

Input Attribute Placeholder
 - Used to provide an example of the input format
 - Does not actually send the placeholder text as input during form submission.
 - Eg: <input type = "email" placeholder = "example@examplemail.com">
 - Doesn't actually contain the text, it only contains example value in a lighter shade.
 - Form doesn't submit the placeholder text if the input value isn't supplied by the user.

Input Attribute "required"
 - Indicates that the field is required.
 - Eg: <input type = "email" required> 
 - The requirement to type some input applies even if the field contains some placeholder text.

Validation Fallback
 - What if browser based validation is not supported for these input attributes? 
    -There are various methods to performing validation tests to browsers that don't support all HTML5 input attributes.
        . Prebuilt Libraries Like JS and jquery libraries
        . Assume that more browsers will support these features over time and leave all final validation to server side
        . Include custom JS validation by coding client side validation that is attached to the form submit event handler.
